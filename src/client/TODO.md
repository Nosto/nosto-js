# Nosto.d.ts plans

The type definition file is generated by the client script, and it is supposed to be dynamically fetched during the dependency install stage. For the first version, however, the file is a copy.

## Changes made

Some changes have been made to the copy which should be moved into the client script itself, or the loading script should handle.

- `// @ts-nocheck` annotation
  - It can be injected dynamically using `awk` or similar tool.
- The following interfaces are now exported
  - These exports should be added to the client script
  - `PushedCustomer`
  - `PushedProduct`
  - `Product`
  - `Data<ProductType extends Product = Product>`
  - `Session`
  - `Action`
  - `ActionResponse`
